# Planka Notifications

A minimal webhook server that bridges Planka's notification system with Slack.

## Philosophy

Planka is a great kanban tool, but its notifications are limited to the web interface.

The goal is simple: when something happens on a card, the right people get notified in the right place with the right
context.

## How It Works

Cards with `notify` in their description trigger Slack messages. You can notify channels (`&shared`, `#general`) and
users (`@john`) in natural language:

```
notify &team-alpha @john
please notify #general &urgent
notification: @admin
```

## Setup

1. Copy `config.js.example` to `config.js`
2. Configure your Slack app:
   - Create a new Slack app at https://api.slack.com/apps
   - Add OAuth scope: `chat:write.public` (allows posting to any public channel)
   - Install the app to your workspace to get a Bot User OAuth Token (starts with `xoxb-`)
   - Copy the Bot Token to `config.js`
   - Optional: Create a `#planka-bot-logs` channel and invite your bot for error logging
3. Configure Planka to send webhooks to your server
4. Add `notify` strings to card descriptions

That's it. No complex integrations, no external dependencies‚Äîjust a simple bridge between two systems that should talk
to each other.

## The Result

Instead of needing to check Planka itself, your team gets contextual updates in Slack:

- üÜï New cards appear with board/list context
- ‚úèÔ∏è Updates show what changed and by whom
- üì§ Card moves track workflow progress
- üí¨ Comments include the full conversation
